Analyzes county-level results in Midwest from 2016-2024 pres. elections

I was motivated to conduct this analysis as I grew up in the suburbs of Kansas in which out of the total four congressional districts the state has to offer, the one I grew up in has been democratic for the past few election cycles. This contrast with Kansas’s broader political reputation at the state-level sparked my curiosity about how voting behavior has evolved across the Midwest more generally. This analysis demonstrates how county-level results can reveal patterns that are hidden by single-election narratives.

For this analysis, I examined county-level presidential election results across 12 Midwestern states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, which surmounted to 1,055 counties (see Appendix A for R code). I utilized publicly available datasets from the 2016, 2020, and 2024 elections from this GitHub repository. My objective was to identify counties that experienced party flips between election cycles and to measure longer-term changes in Democratic and Republican vote share over the 2016–2024 period.

In regards to data methodology and cleansing, I used R to standardize column names and align county-level records across years via tidyverse package. I filtered the data to Midwestern counties and retained key fields, including Democratic and Republican vote totals and vote shares. After merging the datasets by state and county, I identified party flips between 2016 to 2020 and 2020 to 2024, and calculated percentage swings in vote share across the full 2016 to 2024 span.

While 1033 of the 1055 (98%) Midwestern counties maintained their partisan alignment between 2016 and 2024, a few notable exceptions illustrate some interesting dynamics. Out of the remaining 22 counties, 10 flipped from 2020 to 2024. For example, Tippecanoe County, Indiana flipped from Republican in 2016 to Democratic in 2020 before narrowly returning to the Republican in 2024. Despite this short-term change, its Democratic vote share increased by just over five percentage points between 2016 and 2024, suggesting a potential gradual long-term shift toward Democrats.
A similar pattern appeared in Minnesota’s Blue Earth and Nicollet Counties, both of which swung Democratic in 2020 before flipping back to Republicans in 2024, while still ending the period with Democratic vote shares roughly five points higher than in 2016. Winona County also followed this trajectory, though with a smaller net Democratic gain of over two percentage points. These counties suggest that some Midwestern electoral shifts are better understood as gradual realignments rather than permanent flips.

In contrast, counties such as Muskegon and Saginaw in Michigan displayed smaller Democratic gains from 2016 to 2024 while still flipping Republican in 2024, showcasing how modest shifts in vote share depend on turnout and vote margins. Iowa’s Scott County showed minimal net Democratic movement over the period but still experienced a 2024 Republican flip, highlighting the importance of close margins in competitive regions.

Overall, these findings suggest that many apparent party flips reflect short-term electoral volatility coupled with slower moving partisan realignment, highlighting the value of county-level analysis in understanding electoral change.
